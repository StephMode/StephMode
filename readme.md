Web Developer with 5+ years of experience in Project Management and Sales. 
During my professional experience in several Sales-roles I got more and more involved into software development.

This experience has constantly strengthened my interest over time. Thus I took on the challenge of learning web development by going through the comprehensive Web Development Bootcamp at <a href="https://www.neuefische.de/">neuefische</a>.

With a box full of tools for web developement and programming at hand, my fascination for programming and web development has only increased.
I'm genuinly passionate about learning and improving myself and my knowledge. 

Right now, I'm working on projects to hone my skills and I'm also very eager to join a development team to make my contribution real world projects.
